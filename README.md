"# Udacity-noshowappointments-project" 


In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- csv
